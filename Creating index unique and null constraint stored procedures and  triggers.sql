/* USING INDEXES:
The best way to improve the perfromance of SELECT operations is to create indexes on one or more of the 
columns that are tested in the query. The index entries act like pointers to the table rows, allowing the 
query to quickly determine which rows match a condition in the WHERE clause, and retrieve the other column
values for those rows. All MySQL data type can be indexed.alter
